[Version 0.9.1]
 * Less resources are used to open the executable file.
 * The SpawnHeader patterns were actually for CharInfo.  I've corrected this.
 + Merged in the code to find structure offsets.  I haven't verified the patterns 100%, so they make break with a patch quicker.
 + MySEQ styled output is now available.  Simply pass -myseq as the second program argument.

[Version 0.9]
 + Switched from using memory to scanning the file itself.
 - Removed the Memory class from the source tree.
 * Switched the code base to the GPL v3 license.
